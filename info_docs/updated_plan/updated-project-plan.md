## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objective
Development of a comprehensive backend system for analyzing and comparing three pea protein extraction processes:
- Baseline dry fractionation
- RF (Radio Frequency) pre-treatment with dry fractionation  
- IR (Infrared) pre-treatment with dry fractionation

Key analysis components:
- Protein recovery tracking and separation efficiency
- Technical performance assessment (protein yield, purity, particle size)
- Economic analysis (CAPEX, OPEX, NPV)
- Environmental impact assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
- Eco-efficiency analysis incorporating:
  - Economic indicators (NPV, Net Profit, Net Future Worth)
  - Environmental impacts (GWP, HCT, FRS, WC)
  - Product quality metrics (protein purity)
- Comparative analysis of processes including trade-off assessment

### 1.2 Technology Stack
- **Django**: Core application framework, user management, data handling
- **FastAPI**: Process-specific APIs, real-time calculations
- **Rust**: High-performance computations, simulations
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration
- **Python Scientific Stack**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy for economic and protein analysis
- **Statistics/Simulation Libraries**: Monte Carlo simulations, sensitivity analysis
