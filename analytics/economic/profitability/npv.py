    Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of a series of cash flows.
    Based on paper Section 3.2.4

    NPV is calculated as the sum of discounted cash flows minus the initial investment:
    NPV = -I0 + Î£(CFt / (1 + r)^t)
    where:
    - I0 is the initial investment
    - CFt is the cash flow at time t
    - r is the discount rate

    Args:
        cash_flows: List of future cash flows
        discount_rate: Annual discount rate (as decimal)
        initial_investment: Initial investment amount (default: 0.0)

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - npv: Calculated NPV
        - discounted_flows: List of discounted cash flows
        - cumulative_npv: Cumulative NPV by period
